It's like the great stories, Mr. Frodo, the ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn't want so know the end because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad has happened? But in toe end, it's only a passin` thin` this shadow, even darkness must pass. A new day will come, and when the sun shines, it'll shine out the clearer. I know now folks in toose stories had loss of chances of turning back, only shey didn't. They kept going because they were holding on to something. That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for.
